            <p class="font1">Some involve two individual dancers competing against each other in one-on-one battles, but you also have competitions where teams of dancers, known as crews, compete against each other. ... The winner of the battle goes on to the next round and the loser is knocked out of the competition.What is dance Cypher?
                A cypher is freestyle dance jam where an open circle is created and people take turns dancing in the center. The cypher (or cipher) has deep, long-standing cultural roots in hip hop culture, African tradition and even religious beliefs.
                Dancing in all its forms involves five key elements:

                Body: The body is the primary instrument of dance. Dancers may use their entire bodies or limit movement to certain body parts. Professional dancers train their bodies to have exceptional agility and strength.
                Action: Action refers to what the dancer does while dancing, whether they stay rooted in one spot or move across the floor and through the air.
                Space: Dancers move through space in every possible way, varying their level, direction, and path as they move, no matter the form of dance. They also move, often in very specific ways, in relation to other people taking part in a given dance.
                Time: Time is one of the key elements of dance, as it relates to the rhythm of the movements. Performers often choreograph their dances to the meter of the music.
                Energy: The final element of dance, energy, speaks to how the dancers move through space and time. Dancers can use their bodies and their dance technique to make movements that are smooth or sudden, that feel tight and restricted or light and relaxed.
                While the five elements work together in all forms of dancing, dancers can use each element separately.
